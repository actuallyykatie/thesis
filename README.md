# Designing a Service for Communication Within Neighbourhoods
## > highlights
**Main outcome:** Designed an interactive prototype of a service for communication within neighbourhoods as a part of VK.com ecosystem (the largest social networking site in Russia)  
* Conducted a brainstorming workshop (with 11 participants) to identify main user needs and problems  
* Identified additional problems and topics of discussion using computational text analysis (LDA)  
* Formulated push and pull factors, job stories and product vision  
* Performed UX testing by conducting 5 semi-structured interviews  

<sub>Note: this project is not affiliated with VK.com and presents my vision of non-existent product.</sub>
